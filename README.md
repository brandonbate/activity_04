# Activity #4

For this activity, you must complete the [Deployment Tutorial](https://github.com/brandonbate/Deployment-Tutorial) to deploy your forum application (form Project #1) on your Lightsail instance. The content of this tutorial was taken from these Pre-Class videos:

* [Chapter 9: Testing Deployment Using a Staging Site](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYhNXXgNKwY)
* [Chapter 10: Getting to a Production-Ready Deployment](https://youtu.be/rO4KfAl6N4g)

You do not need to upload anything to this repository. Just show me you completed this either in class or in my office.
